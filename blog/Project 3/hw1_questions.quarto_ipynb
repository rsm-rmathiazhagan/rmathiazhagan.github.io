        "Dean Karlan at Yale and John List at the University of Chicago conducted a field experiment to test the effectiveness of different fundraising letters. They sent out 50,000 fundraising letters to potential donors, randomly assigning each letter to one of three treatments: a standard letter, a matching grant letter, or a challenge grant letter. They published the results of this experiment in the _American Economic Review_ in 2007. The article and supporting data are available from the [AEA website](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.97.5.1774) and from Innovations for Poverty Action as part of [Harvard's Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/27853&version=4.2).\n",
        "\n",
        "To better understand the demand side of charitable giving, Karlan and List used a natural field experiment involving over 50,000 previous donors to a politically liberal nonprofit organization. The letters were randomized to test three main dimensions: whether a matching grant was offered, the ratio of the match (1:1, 2:1, or 3:1), and the size of the matching fund ($25,000, $50,000, $100,000, or unstated). In addition, suggested donation amounts were varied using multipliers of the recipientâ€™s previous highest contribution. Their findings revealed that simply offering a match significantly increased both the likelihood of donating and the average amount raised per letter. However, increasing the match ratio beyond 1:1 did not yield additional benefits, challenging conventional fundraising wisdom. Notably, the effect of matching offers was more pronounced in conservative-leaning (\"red\") states, suggesting that political context may shape donor responsiveness.\n",
