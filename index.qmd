I'm currently pursuing my Master of Science in Business Analytics (MSBA) as part of the 2025 cohort at UC San Diego's Rady School of Management. With a strong foundation in data analysis, Python, SQL, and data visualization tools like Tableau, I enjoy uncovering insights that drive smarter decisions. I'm also an avid sports enthusiast, always inspired by the intersection of data and performanceâ€”whether it's in business or on the field.
