    "text": "Dean Karlan at Yale and John List at the University of Chicago conducted a field experiment to test the effectiveness of different fundraising letters. They sent out 50,000 fundraising letters to potential donors, randomly assigning each letter to one of three treatments: a standard letter, a matching grant letter, or a challenge grant letter. They published the results of this experiment in the American Economic Review in 2007. The article and supporting data are available from the AEA website and from Innovations for Poverty Action as part of Harvard’s Dataverse.\nTo better understand the demand side of charitable giving, Karlan and List used a natural field experiment involving over 50,000 previous donors to a politically liberal nonprofit organization. The letters were randomized to test three main dimensions: whether a matching grant was offered, the ratio of the match (1:1, 2:1, or 3:1), and the size of the matching fund ($25,000, $50,000, $100,000, or unstated). In addition, suggested donation amounts were varied using multipliers of the recipient’s previous highest contribution. Their findings revealed that simply offering a match significantly increased both the likelihood of donating and the average amount raised per letter. However, increasing the match ratio beyond 1:1 did not yield additional benefits, challenging conventional fundraising wisdom. Notably, the effect of matching offers was more pronounced in conservative-leaning (“red”) states, suggesting that political context may shape donor responsiveness.\nThis project seeks to replicate their results."

Do each as a t-test and separately as a linear regression, and confirm you get the exact same results from both methods. When doing a t-test, use the formula in the class slides. When doing the linear regression, regress for example mrm2 on treatment and look at the estimated coefficient on the treatment variable. It might be helpful to compare parts of your analysis to Table 1 in the paper. Be sure to comment on your results (hint: why is Table 1 included in the paper).\n\nlibrary(haven)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(broom)\n\n# Load dataset\ndata &lt;- read_dta(\"karlan_list_2007.dta\")\n\n# Split data by treatment\ntreat &lt;- filter(data, treatment == 1)\ncontrol &lt;- filter(data, treatment == 0)\n\n# Variables to test\nvars &lt;- c(\"mrm2\", \"hpa\", \"freq\",\"page18_39\",\"red0\")\n\n# Function to report results\nfor (var in vars) {\n  cat(\"\\n==============================\\n\")\n  cat(\"Variable:\", var, \"\\n\")\n  \n  # Means and SDs\n  treat_mean &lt;- mean(treat[[var]], na.rm = TRUE)\n  control_mean &lt;- mean(control[[var]], na.rm = TRUE)\n  treat_sd &lt;- sd(treat[[var]], na.rm = TRUE)\n  control_sd &lt;- sd(control[[var]], na.rm = TRUE)\n  overall_mean &lt;- mean(data[[var]], na.rm = TRUE)\n  overall_sd &lt;- sd(data[[var]], na.rm = TRUE)\n  \n  cat(\"Treatment Mean:\", round(treat_mean, 3), \"SD:\", round(treat_sd, 3), \"\\n\")\n  cat(\"Control Mean:  \", round(control_mean, 3), \"SD:\", round(control_sd, 3), \"\\n\")\n  \n  # T-test\n  ttest &lt;- t.test(as.formula(paste(var, \"~ treatment\")), data = data)\n  cat(\"T-test p-value:\", round(ttest$p.value, 4), \"\\n\")\n  \n  # Regression\n  model &lt;- lm(as.formula(paste(var, \"~ treatment\")), data = data)\n  coef_summary &lt;- tidy(model) %&gt;% filter(term == \"treatment\")\n  cat(\"Regression Coefficient:\", round(coef_summary$estimate, 4), \"\\n\")\n  cat(\"Regression p-value:    \", round(coef_summary$p.value, 4), \"\\n\")\n}\n\n\n==============================\nVariable: mrm2 \nTreatment Mean: 13.012 SD: 12.086 \nControl Mean:   12.998 SD: 12.074 \nT-test p-value: 0.9049 \nRegression Coefficient: 0.0137 \nRegression p-value:     0.9049 \n\n==============================\nVariable: hpa \nTreatment Mean: 59.597 SD: 73.052 \nControl Mean:   58.96 SD: 67.269 \nT-test p-value: 0.3318 \nRegression Coefficient: 0.6371 \nRegression p-value:     0.3451 \n\n==============================\nVariable: freq \nTreatment Mean: 8.035 SD: 11.39 \nControl Mean:   8.047 SD: 11.404 \nT-test p-value: 0.9117 \nRegression Coefficient: -0.012 \nRegression p-value:     0.9117 \n\n==============================\nVariable: page18_39 \nTreatment Mean: 0.322 SD: 0.103 \nControl Mean:   0.322 SD: 0.103 \nT-test p-value: 0.9011 \nRegression Coefficient: -1e-04 \nRegression p-value:     0.901 \n\n==============================\nVariable: red0 \nTreatment Mean: 0.407 SD: 0.491 \nControl Mean:   0.399 SD: 0.49 \nT-test p-value: 0.0605 \nRegression Coefficient: 0.0087 \nRegression p-value:     0.0608 \n\n\nAll tested variables show very similar means and standard deviations across treatment and control groups, as expected under successful randomization. The t-test and regression p-values are nearly identical and all above 0.05, indicating no statistically significant imbalance. These results replicate Table 1 in the Karlan & List (2007) paper, which is included to show that randomization produced comparable groups on observable characteristics."

This confirms the finding in Table 2A, Panel A, where the response rate increases from 1.8% to 2.2% when matching is introduced.\nThe bivariate linear regression yields an equivalent result: the coefficient on treatment is positive and significant, indicating that simply offering a match increases the likelihood of donation.\nInterpretation: Even a small increase in donation probability — from just under 2% to just over 2% — is meaningful in a large fundraising campaign. This suggests that people are psychologically responsive to matching offers, even when the absolute value of the match is not very large. The perception of increased impact (“my $10 becomes $20”) may be enough to nudge more people into giving. This supports the idea that framing and context matter in charitable behavior, not just individual preferences.\n\nlibrary(haven)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(broom)\nlibrary(margins)\n\n# Load data\ndata &lt;- read_dta(\"karlan_list_2007.dta\")\n\n# Probit regression: gave ~ treatment\nprobit_model &lt;- glm(gave ~ treatment, data = data, family = binomial(link = \"probit\"))\n\n# Summary of the model\nsummary(probit_model)\n\n\nCall:\nglm(formula = gave ~ treatment, family = binomial(link = \"probit\"), \n    data = data)\n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std.

This confirms that assignment to the treatment group — those who received a matching donation offer — was associated with a higher probability of making a donation.\nThe result is statistically significant at the 1% level, providing strong evidence that the offer of a match influenced donor behavior. While the numerical value of the coefficient may seem modest, its significance within a nonlinear probit framework reinforces the idea that behavioral prompts like matching gifts can effectively shape outcomes.\nIn essence, this supports the broader finding from Karlan and List (2007): even relatively small psychological nudges can meaningfully impact decision-making in a real-world charitable context.\n\n\nDifferences between Match Rates\nNext, I assess the effectiveness of different sizes of matched donations on the response rate.\n\nlibrary(haven)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n# Load data\ndata &lt;- read_dta(\"karlan_list_2007.dta\")\n\n# Filter only the people who were in a match group (i.e., treatment == 1)\nmatched &lt;- filter(data, treatment == 1)\n\n# Create a variable for 1:1 match (implied if ratio2 and ratio3 are both 0)\nmatched &lt;- matched %&gt;%\n  mutate(ratio1 = ifelse(ratio2 == 0 & ratio3 == 0, 1, 0))\n\n# T-test: 2:1 match vs 1:1 match\nt_21_vs_11 &lt;- t.test(gave ~ ratio2, data = filter(matched, ratio1 == 1 | ratio2 == 1))\n\n# T-test: 3:1 match vs 1:1 match\nt_31_vs_11 &lt;- t.test(gave ~ ratio3, data = filter(matched, ratio1 == 1 | ratio3 == 1))\n\n# Output results\ncat(\"T-test: 2:1 vs 1:1 match rate\\n\")\n\nT-test: 2:1 vs 1:1 match rate\n\nprint(t_21_vs_11)\n\n\n    Welch Two Sample t-test\n\ndata:  gave by ratio2\nt = -0.96505, df = 22225, p-value = 0.3345\nalternative hypothesis: true difference in means between group 0 and group 1 is not equal to 0\n95 percent confidence interval:\n -0.005711275  0.001942773\nsample estimates:\nmean in group 0 mean in group 1 \n     0.02074912      0.02263338 \n\ncat(\"\\nT-test: 3:1 vs 1:1 match rate\\n\")\n\n\nT-test: 3:1 vs 1:1 match rate\n\nprint(t_31_vs_11)\n\n\n    Welch Two Sample t-test\n\ndata:  gave by ratio3\nt = -1.015, df = 22215, p-value = 0.3101\nalternative hypothesis: true difference in means between group 0 and group 1 is not equal to 0\n95 percent confidence interval:\n -0.005816051  0.001847501\nsample estimates:\nmean in group 0 mean in group 1 \n     0.02074912      0.02273340 \n\n\n\n\nEffectiveness of Different Match Ratios: T-Test Results\nTo evaluate whether more generous match ratios (2:1 and 3:1) increase the likelihood of donating compared to the standard 1:1 match, I conducted two t-tests:\n\n2:1 vs 1:1 match rate\n3:1 vs 1:1 match rate\n\nIn both cases, the t-tests found no statistically significant difference in the probability of donation. The p-value for the 2:1 vs 1:1 comparison was 0.3345, and for the 3:1 vs 1:1 comparison it was 0.3101 — both well above the conventional significance threshold of 0.05.\nThe estimated differences in means were very small, with confidence intervals that include zero, indicating no reliable effect of increasing the match ratio.\nThese results support the authors’ comment on page 8 of the paper that “larger match ratios had no additional impact.” In other words, donors respond to the presence of a match offer, but increasing the match from 1:1 to 2:1 or 3:1 does not lead to a higher response rate.\nThis finding reinforces a key insight from behavioral economics: perceived opportunity or framing (i.e., the existence of a match), rather than the size of the match, drives behavior in charitable giving contexts.\n\nlibrary(haven)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(broom)\n\n# Load data\ndata &lt;- read_dta(\"karlan_list_2007.dta\")\n\n# Subset only treatment group (those who received any match)\nmatched &lt;- filter(data, treatment == 1)\n\n# Create ratio1 manually: it's the group not in ratio2 or ratio3\nmatched &lt;- matched %&gt;%\n  mutate(ratio1 = ifelse(ratio2 == 0 & ratio3 == 0, 1, 0))\n\n# Run regression with dummy variables (ratio1 is implicit baseline)\nmodel_ratios &lt;- lm(gave ~ ratio2 + ratio3, data = matched)\n\n# Output tidy summary\ntidy(model_ratios)\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 5\n  term        estimate std.error statistic  p.value\n  &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 (Intercept)  0.0207    0.00139    14.9   3.98e-50\n2 ratio2       0.00188   0.00197     0.958 3.38e- 1\n3 ratio3       0.00198   0.00197     1.01  3.13e- 1\n\n\n\n\nRegression Analysis: Impact of Match Ratio on Donation Behavior\nTo assess whether the generosity of the match offer affects the likelihood of donating, I ran a linear regression using data from individuals who were in the treatment group. The model includes dummy variables for the 2:1 and 3:1 match offers, with the 1:1 match offer serving as the reference category.\nThe regression results show that: - The coefficient on ratio2 is 0.00188 with a standard error of 0.00197, and a p-value of 0.338. - The coefficient on ratio3 is 0.00198 with a standard error of 0.00197, and a p-value of 0.313.\nThese coefficients represent the difference in donation probability relative to the 1:1 match group. However, both coefficients are small and statistically insignificant, indicating that neither the 2:1 nor 3:1 match rate led to a meaningful increase in the likelihood of donating compared to a 1:1 match.\nThese findings are entirely consistent with earlier t-test results and support the authors’ conclusion that increasing the match ratio has no additional effect. The behavioral impact appears to stem from the presence of a match offer itself, rather than its magnitude. Donors may not be especially sensitive to whether the match is 1:1 or 3:1 — the idea of leverage seems to matter more than the amount.\n\nlibrary(haven)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(broom)\n\n# Load data\ndata &lt;- read_dta(\"karlan_list_2007.dta\")\n\n# Keep only treatment group\nmatched &lt;- filter(data, treatment == 1)\n\n# Create 1:1 dummy\nmatched &lt;- matched %&gt;%\n  mutate(ratio1 = ifelse(ratio2 == 0 & ratio3 == 0, 1, 0))\n\n# ----- APPROACH 1: Direct from the data -----\n\n# Compute response rates by match group\nresponse_rates &lt;- matched %&gt;%\n  mutate(ratio_type = case_when(\n    ratio1 == 1 ~ \"1:1\",\n    ratio2 == 1 ~ \"2:1\",\n    ratio3 == 1 ~ \"3:1\"\n  )) %&gt;%\n  group_by(ratio_type) %&gt;%\n  summarise(response_rate = mean(gave, na.rm = TRUE))\n\n# Extract values for comparison\nrate_1_1 &lt;- response_rates$response_rate[response_rates$ratio_type == \"1:1\"]\nrate_2_1 &lt;- response_rates$response_rate[response_rates$ratio_type == \"2:1\"]\nrate_3_1 &lt;- response_rates$response_rate[response_rates$ratio_type == \"3:1\"]\n\n# Calculate differences\ndiff_21_11 &lt;- rate_2_1 - rate_1_1\ndiff_31_21 &lt;- rate_3_1 - rate_2_1\n\n# ----- APPROACH 2: From regression coefficients -----\n\n# Run regression using 1:1 (ratio1) as the baseline\nmodel &lt;- lm(gave ~ ratio2 + ratio3, data = matched)\nmodel_out &lt;- tidy(model)\n\n# Coefficient difference (they are relative to 1:1 group)\ncoef_21_11 &lt;- model_out$estimate[model_out$term == \"ratio2\"]\ncoef_31_21 &lt;- model_out$estimate[model_out$term == \"ratio3\"] - coef_21_11\n\n# Output results\ncat(\"== Response Rate Differences from Raw Data ==\\n\")\n\n== Response Rate Differences from Raw Data ==\n\ncat(\"2:1 - 1:1 =\", round(diff_21_11, 5), \"\\n\")\n\n2:1 - 1:1 = 0.00188 \n\ncat(\"3:1 - 2:1 =\", round(diff_31_21, 5), \"\\n\")\n\n3:1 - 2:1 = 1e-04 \n\ncat(\"\\n== Differences in Fitted Coefficients ==\\n\")\n\n\n== Differences in Fitted Coefficients ==\n\ncat(\"2:1 vs 1:1 =\", round(coef_21_11, 5), \"\\n\")\n\n2:1 vs 1:1 = 0.00188 \n\ncat(\"3:1 vs 2:1 =\", round(coef_31_21, 5), \"\\n\")\n\n3:1 vs 2:1 = 1e-04 \n\n\n\n\nMatch Ratio Differences: Response Rate and Regression Analysis\nTo understand whether higher match ratios increase the likelihood of donation, I calculated response rate differences in two ways:\n\n1. Differences in Raw Response Rates\n\n2:1 vs 1:1 match ratio: 0.00188\n3:1 vs 2:1 match ratio: 0.00010\n\n\n\n2. Differences in Fitted Coefficients (Linear Model)\n\n2:1 vs 1:1: 0.00188\n3:1 vs 2:1: 0.00010\n\nBoth approaches yielded the same differences, confirming that the estimated impact of increasing the match ratio is extremely small — around 0.1 to 0.2 percentage points.\n\n\n\nConclusion\nThese findings provide strong evidence that increasing the match ratio from 1:1 to 2:1 or from 2:1 to 3:1 does not significantly increase the probability that someone donates.\nThis aligns with the authors’ conclusion: the presence of a match offer, rather than its generosity, is what motivates donations. Donors respond to the idea of a match, but larger matches do not provide additional behavioral lift.\nIn sum, the marginal effectiveness of more generous matches is negligible — a key insight for fundraisers seeking efficient campaign strategies.\n\n\nSize of Charitable Contribution\nIn this subsection, I analyze the effect of the size of matched donation on the size of the charitable contribution.\n\nlibrary(haven)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(broom)\n\n# Load data\ndata &lt;- read_dta(\"karlan_list_2007.dta\")\n\n# T-test: Compare average donation amount\nt_test_amount &lt;- t.test(amount ~ treatment, data = data)\ncat(\"== T-test: Donation Amount by Treatment Status ==\\n\")\n\n== T-test: Donation Amount by Treatment Status ==\n\nprint(t_test_amount)\n\n\n    Welch Two Sample t-test\n\ndata:  amount by treatment\nt = -1.9183, df = 36216, p-value = 0.05509\nalternative hypothesis: true difference in means between group 0 and group 1 is not equal to 0\n95 percent confidence interval:\n -0.310555423  0.003344493\nsample estimates:\nmean in group 0 mean in group 1 \n      0.8132678       0.9668733 \n\n# Regression: Amount ~ Treatment\nmodel_amount &lt;- lm(amount ~ treatment, data = data)\ncat(\"\\n== Linear Regression: Amount ~ Treatment ==\\n\")\n\n\n== Linear Regression: Amount ~ Treatment ==\n\ntidy(model_amount)\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 5\n  term        estimate std.error statistic  p.value\n  &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 (Intercept)    0.813    0.0674     12.1  1.84e-33\n2 treatment      0.154    0.0826      1.86 6.28e- 2\n\n\n\n\nEffect of Match Offers on Donation Amounts\nTo assess whether being offered a matching donation opportunity affects the amount individuals donate, I conducted both a t-test and a bivariate linear regression using the full dataset.\nThe t-test comparing average donation amounts between treatment and control groups yielded a p-value of 0.055, which is just above the traditional 5% significance threshold. The average donation was $0.81 in the control group and $0.97 in the treatment group — a difference of approximately $0.15.\nThe linear regression of donation amount on treatment status produced a coefficient of 0.154 with a p-value of 0.0628, again marginally above the 5% threshold. This suggests a small, positive effect of treatment on donation amount, but not strong enough to be deemed statistically significant at conventional levels.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThese results indicate that being offered a match may slightly increase the average amount donated, but the evidence is not strong enough to make a confident causal claim. The p-values suggest that the observed difference might be due to chance, though the direction of the effect (positive) is consistent with the broader narrative of the study.\nIn summary, while matching offers clearly increase the likelihood that someone donates, the evidence that they increase the size of the donation (unconditionally) is suggestive but not definitive.\n\nlibrary(haven)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(broom)\n\n# Load the data\ndata &lt;- read_dta(\"karlan_list_2007.dta\")\n\n# Filter to donors only (those who gave something)\ndonors_only &lt;- filter(data, gave == 1)\n\n# T-test: Compare average amount given among donors\nt_test_donors &lt;- t.test(amount ~ treatment, data = donors_only)\ncat(\"== T-test: Donation Amount by Treatment Status (Donors Only) ==\\n\")\n\n== T-test: Donation Amount by Treatment Status (Donors Only) ==\n\nprint(t_test_donors)\n\n\n    Welch Two Sample t-test\n\ndata:  amount by treatment\nt = 0.58461, df = 557.46, p-value = 0.559\nalternative hypothesis: true difference in means between group 0 and group 1 is not equal to 0\n95 percent confidence interval:\n -3.937240  7.274027\nsample estimates:\nmean in group 0 mean in group 1 \n       45.54027        43.87188 \n\n# Regression: Amount ~ Treatment (among donors)\nmodel_donors &lt;- lm(amount ~ treatment, data = donors_only)\ncat(\"\\n== Linear Regression: Amount ~ Treatment (Donors Only) ==\\n\")\n\n\n== Linear Regression: Amount ~ Treatment (Donors Only) ==\n\ntidy(model_donors)\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 5\n  term        estimate std.error statistic  p.value\n  &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 (Intercept)    45.5       2.42    18.8   5.47e-68\n2 treatment      -1.67      2.87    -0.581 5.61e- 1\n\n\n\n\nConditional Effect of Treatment on Donation Amount (Among Donors Only)\nTo examine whether match offers influenced how much people donated — conditional on having donated — I restricted the dataset to only those individuals who gave a positive amount.\n\nT-Test Results\nThe average donation among the control group was $45.54, while the average in the treatment group was $43.87. The t-test revealed no statistically significant difference between the two groups (p = 0.559). The 95% confidence interval for the difference in means includes zero, reinforcing this conclusion.\n\n\nRegression Results\nThe linear regression of donation amount on treatment (among donors only) produced a coefficient of -1.67, indicating that those in the treatment group donated slightly less on average. However, the effect is not statistically significant (p = 0.561).\n\n\nInterpretation and Causal Insights\nThese results suggest that being offered a match does not influence the size of the donation, once someone has decided to donate. In fact, if anything, treated individuals gave slightly less, though the difference is not meaningful.\nImportantly, this analysis is conditional on donation behavior, which was itself affected by the treatment. Because we are conditioning on a post-treatment variable (gave), the regression coefficient does not have a causal interpretation. The group of donors in the treatment group may differ in unobservable ways from donors in the control group, and this could bias the estimate.\nIn summary, this analysis tells us that the treatment affects the extensive margin (whether people give), not the intensive margin (how much they give) — a conclusion that aligns with the broader findings of Karlan and List (2007).\n\nlibrary(haven)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n# Load data\ndata &lt;- read_dta(\"karlan_list_2007.dta\")\n\n# Filter to donors only\ndonors &lt;- filter(data, gave == 1)\n\n# Calculate group means\ngroup_means &lt;- donors %&gt;%\n  group_by(treatment) %&gt;%\n  summarise(mean_amount = mean(amount, na.rm = TRUE))\n\n# Plot for Treatment Group\nggplot(filter(donors, treatment == 1), aes(x = amount)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5, fill = \"skyblue\", color = \"white\") +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = group_means$mean_amount[group_means$treatment == 1],\n             color = \"red\", size = 1) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Donation Amounts (Treatment Group)\",\n    x = \"Amount Donated\",\n    y = \"Count\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\nWarning: Using `size` aesthetic for lines was deprecated in ggplot2 3.4.0.\nℹ Please use `linewidth` instead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Plot for Control Group\nggplot(filter(donors, treatment == 0), aes(x = amount)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5, fill = \"lightgreen\", color = \"white\") +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = group_means$mean_amount[group_means$treatment == 0],\n             color = \"red\", size = 1) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Donation Amounts (Control Group)\",\n    x = \"Amount Donated\",\n    y = \"Count\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDonation Amount Distributions: Treatment vs. Control (Donors Only)\nThe two histograms above show the distribution of donation amounts among individuals who made a donation, separated by treatment assignment. The red vertical line in each plot marks the average donation amount within that group.\n\nIn the treatment group, the distribution of donations is right-skewed, with most donations falling between $10 and $100. The average donation is just below $44.\nIn the control group, the pattern is similar, though the average donation is slightly higher, around $45.5.\n\nVisually, the distributions are quite similar. Both groups show large clustering at common donation levels (e.g., $25, $50, $100), suggesting donors may be responding to standard ask amounts or psychological anchors.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThese plots support the earlier statistical analysis: being offered a match does not appear to increase the average amount donated among those who give. In fact, the average donation is marginally lower in the treatment group. However, this difference is not statistically significant, and the shapes of the two distributions are nearly identical.\nThis visualization reinforces the paper’s broader conclusion that matching gifts increase the likelihood of giving, but not the size of the donation once that decision has been made. The behavioral nudge seems to influence the extensive margin (give vs. not give), not the intensive margin (how much to give)."

Specifically, we simulate 100,000 values from the control distribution and 10,000 from the treatment distribution, then compute the difference in means one pair at a time. The blue line shows the evolving average of those differences as the sample size increases.\nAt the beginning of the plot, we see high variability — the cumulative average fluctuates wildly with the first few draws. This reflects the influence of random noise when the sample size is small. However, as the number of observations increases, the cumulative average begins to stabilize, eventually converging toward the red dashed line, which represents the true difference in means between the treatment and control groups.\nThis behavior is a textbook demonstration of the Law of Large Numbers: as sample size increases, the sample average becomes a more accurate estimate of the population average. In practical terms, it tells us that while individual comparisons may be noisy, large samples can reveal reliable patterns. Here, the cumulative average confirms the treatment group tends to donate more than the control group — and that this effect emerges clearly as sample size grows.\n\n\nCentral Limit Theorem\n\nset.seed(123)\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n# Simulate sampling distribution of differences\nsimulate_diff_means &lt;- function(n, reps = 1000, mu_c = 0.813, mu_t = 0.966, sd = 10) {\n  diffs &lt;- replicate(reps, {\n    mean(rnorm(n, mean = mu_t, sd = sd)) - mean(rnorm(n, mean = mu_c, sd = sd))\n  })\n  data.frame(diff = diffs, sample_size = paste0(\"n = \", n))\n}\n\n# Generate datasets\nsizes &lt;- c(50, 200, 500, 1000)\nsim_data &lt;- do.call(rbind, lapply(sizes, simulate_diff_means))\n\n# Plot histograms\nggplot(sim_data, aes(x = diff)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins = 40, fill = \"steelblue\", color = \"white\") +\n  facet_wrap(~sample_size, scales = \"free\", ncol = 2) +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 0, color = \"red\", linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Sampling Distribution of Differences in Means\",\n    subtitle = \"Simulated at Varying Sample Sizes\",\n    x = \"Difference in Means (Treatment - Control)\",\n    y = \"Count\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSampling Distributions at Different Sample Sizes\nThe four histograms above show the sampling distribution of the difference in means between treatment and control groups at sample sizes of 50, 200, 500, and 1000. Each plot represents 1,000 simulations where, for each simulation, we draw n observations from each group, compute their sample means, and record the difference.\n\nAt n = 50, the distribution is wide and noisy, with a substantial spread. In this case, zero is near the center of the distribution, meaning we would often observe a difference close to zero just by chance.\nAt n = 200, the distribution is more concentrated, though still displays some variability. Zero is still within the range of plausible outcomes, but less frequently near the center.\nAt n = 500, the sampling distribution narrows significantly, and zero starts to move toward the edge of the distribution — suggesting stronger evidence of a real difference.\nAt n = 1000, the distribution is tight and centered around the true mean difference. Zero is now well into the tails, meaning it’s unlikely we would observe a difference this close to zero if the treatment and control distributions were truly the same.\n\n\n\nWhat We Learn\nThese plots visually demonstrate the power of larger sample sizes. As the sample size increases: - The sampling variability decreases - The sampling distribution becomes more precise - We are better able to detect small true differences in population means\nThis is a direct illustration of the Central Limit Theorem and the Law of Large Numbers in action. At larger sample sizes, we can distinguish signal from noise more effectively — and zero becomes an unlikely outcome when a real treatment effect exists."
